### [H-Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/)

Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper, return *the researcher's h-index*.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): The h-index is defined as the maximum value of `h` such that the given researcher has published at least `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == citations.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`

```C
int hIndex(int* citations, int citationsSize){
    int* tbl = calloc(5000, sizeof(int));
    for(int i=0; i<citationsSize; i++) tbl[citations[i]]++;
    int cite = 0;
    int i = 4999;
    for(i=4999; i>0; i--){
        cite += tbl[i];
        if(cite>=i) break;
    }
    free(tbl);
    return i;
}
```
