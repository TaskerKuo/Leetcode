### [Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":

- The "linked list" should use the same `TreeNode` class where the `right` child pointer points to the next node in the list and the `left` child pointer is always `null`.
- The "linked list" should be in the same order as a [**pre-order** **traversal**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Pre-order,_NLR) of the binary tree.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,5,3,4,null,6]
Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [0]
Output: [0]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

```C
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     struct TreeNode *left;
 *     struct TreeNode *right;
 * };
 */
typedef struct TreeNode Tnode;
void flatten(struct TreeNode* root){
    Tnode* curr = root;
    while(curr!=NULL){
        if(curr->left!=NULL){
            Tnode* prev = curr->left;
            while(prev->right) prev = prev->right;
            prev->right = curr-> right;
            curr->right = curr->left;
            curr->left = NULL;
        }
        curr = curr->right;
    }
}
```
