### [Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return *the middle node of the linked list*.

If there are two middle nodes, return **the second middle** node.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,4,5]
Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [4,5,6]
Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 100`



```C
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     struct ListNode *next;
 * };
 */


struct ListNode* middleNode(struct ListNode* head){
    struct ListNode* ll = head;
    int count = 0;
    while(head){
        head = head->next;
        count++;
    }
    count /= 2;
    while(count>0){
        ll = ll->next;
        count--;
    }
    return  ll;
}
```
